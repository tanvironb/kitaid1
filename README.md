## 📱 Project Overview
KitaID is a cross-platform mobile application developed to modernize digital identity management and verification in Malaysia. The app provides a centralized, secure, and user-friendly platform that allows users to store, manage, and verify multiple identity documents digitally, reducing reliance on physical cards.

This project was developed as a **Final Year Project (FYP2)** for the **Bachelor of Information Technology (Hons)** at the **Kulliyyah of Information and Communication Technology (KICT), IIUM**.

📄 Full technical details are available in the **Final Report**: :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Malaysian citizens and foreign residents are required to carry multiple physical identity documents such as:
- MyKad  
- I-Kad  
- Passport  
- Driving License  

These physical documents are prone to **loss, damage, theft, forgery**, and **inefficient manual verification**. While some digital solutions exist (e.g., MyJPJ), they operate in isolation and do not provide a unified digital identity platform.

---

## 💡 Solution: KitaID
KitaID addresses these challenges by offering:
- A **centralized digital identity wallet**
- **QR-based identity verification**
- **Biometric authentication** (Face ID / Fingerprint)
- **Real-time notifications**
- **Secure document storage**

The app demonstrates how a national digital identity platform could function using modern mobile and cloud technologies.
